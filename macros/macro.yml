macros:
  - name: corr
    description: |
      This macro calculates the Kendall Tau rank correlation coefficient between two columns in a specified table.
      It works by performing pairwise comparisons between the values in the specified columns and checking whether 
      the pairs are concordant (both increase or both decrease) or discordant (one increases, the other decreases).
    arguments:
      - name: column_a
        type: string
        description: "The name of the first column for which you want to calculate the correlation."
      - name: column_b
        type: string
        description: "The name of the second column for which you want to calculate the correlation."
      - name: table_name
        type: string
        description: "The name of the table containing the columns for correlation calculation."
    

  - name: group_by
    description: |
      This macro dynamically generates a `GROUP BY` clause for a specified number of columns.
      It is useful when you need to programmatically specify a group of columns without manually writing them out. 
      E.g.  group_by(3)  instead of GROUP BY 1,2,3
    arguments:
      - name: n
        type: integer
        description: "The number of columns to include in the GROUP BY clause."
