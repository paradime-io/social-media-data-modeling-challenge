### Step 2: Bringing in New Data
You can bring in any data you want as long as it's user-generated social media data or relevant data to supplement the user-generated social media data.

#### How to bring in New Data

- Your MotherDuck account includes a sample social media dataset, [hacker_news](https://news.ycombinator.com/), which contains posts and comments. 
- Your Paradime account links to this GitHub repository, with a pre-configured dbt‚Ñ¢ model, stg_hacker_news.sql, which references the hackernews table in MotherDuck. 

*Important:* These resources are provided merely as a convenience. You are not required to use this in your project. In fact, to excel in this challenge, you must bring in data on your own. 

#### How to bring new data into MotherDuck
1. Query data directly from your [local machine](https://motherduck.com/docs/key-tasks/loading-data-into-motherduck/loading-data-from-local-machine/) or [an object storage service](https://motherduck.com/docs/key-tasks/loading-data-into-motherduck/loading-data-from-cloud-or-https/) (AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage).
2. Query data directly from [Hugging Face](https://duckdb.org/docs/extensions/httpfs/hugging_face), which has countless social media datasets at your disposal.

### Step 3: Generate Insights
Use Paradime, MotherDuck, and Hex to uncover compelling insights from social media data. Aim for accurate, relevant, and engaging discoveries.
