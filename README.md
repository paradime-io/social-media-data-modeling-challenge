### Step 1: Registration and Verification
- **Submit Your Application**: Fill out the [registration form](https://www.paradime.io/dbt-data-modeling-challenge-movie-edition#div-registration-form).
- **Verification by Paradime**: We'll review your application against the [entry requirements](https://www.paradime.io/dbt-data-modeling-challenge-movie-edition#div-how-it-works-2).

### Step 2: Confirmation
After verification, you'll receive two confirmation eamils from Paradime:
1. **Snowflake Account Credentials**: Contains your Snowflake account details. Search for an email with subject line "*Credentials - dbt™ Data Modeling Challenge - Social Media Edition*."
2. **Paradime Platform Invitation**: An invitation to access the Paradime Platform. Search for an email with the subject line "*[Paradime] Activate your account*."

### Step 3: Account Setup
Using the instructions outlined in the confirmation email,"*Credentials - dbt™ Data Modeling Challenge - Social Media Edition*.", set up your accounts: 
- **MotherDuck**
- **Paradime**
  - Create Account
  - Connect to MotherDuck
  - **Create your GitHub Branch**: Open the Paradime Editor and create a new branch. Your branch name should follow this format: "<first_name>_<last_name>". For guidance, see this [step-by-step tutorial](https://app.arcade.software/share/7kRyaYbPoGc5ofmJfmvY)
- **Hex**

### Step 4: Kickstart Your Project

- **Start Developing**: Begin crafting SQL queries, developing dbt™ models, and generating insights!

**Need Additional Help?**

## Building Your Project

Now that you're set up, you have until **September 2nd, 2024** to submit your project!

### Step 1: Getting to Know the Tools
- **Paradime**:
   - Get familiar with the paradime IDE using this [interactive guide](https://app.arcade.software/share/7kRyaYbPoGc5ofmJfmvY). You can also watch our YouTube videos:
   - [All features in our intuitive IDE Apps Panel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQtIn-tnnbg)
   - [AI-enabled IDE for dbt™ development | DinoAI | Paradime.io](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WG4JUv3sI8)
  - **Paradime Help Docs**: For a comprehensive understanding of all the features and how to make the most of Paradime for your project, explore the [Paradime Help Docs](https://docs.paradime.io/app-help/welcome-to-paradime.io/readme).
- **MotherDuck**:
- **Lightdash**: Discover how to setup and utilize Lightdash in this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4Y0KM0MroQ).

### Step 2: Getting to Know the Social Media Data Data
Your motherDuck . These data sets contain roughly 1,700,000 rows of detailed Movie and TV Show data.
Please understand that these data sets are not entirely accurate; They're simply a starting point - you will need to bring in your datasets to truly excel in this challenge.
- **In Snowflake**: Directly explore the datasets in [Snowflake](https://app.snowflake.com/kbuwhsf/xrb98600) for hands-on analysis.
- **GitHub Repository Resources**:
  - [Staging Files](https://github.com/paradime-io/paradime-dbt-movie-challenge/tree/main/models/sources): These files provide a preliminary view and structure of the datasets available in this repository.
  - [schema.yml File](https://github.com/paradime-io/paradime-dbt-movie-challenge/blob/main/models/sources/schema.yml): This file contains schema definitions, helping you understand the data models and their relationships.
- **Paradime Catalog UI**: Use the [Paradime Catalog UI](https://app.paradime.io/catalog/search) for an interactive exploration of the datasets, featuring intuitive search and navigation.

### Step 3: Generating Insights
Your primary goal is to construct dbt™ models that unearth compelling insights, captivating Movie fans. These three datasets are your starting point, and as you bring in additional data, the possibilities for discovery are virtually limitless. This is your playground to innovate and explore the depths of Movie and TV data.

Before diving in, ensure you're familiar with the [Judging Criteria](https://www.paradime.io/dbt-data-modeling-challenge-movie-edition#div-how-it-works-2) so you have a chance to win the [$500-$1500 Amazon gift cards](https://www.paradime.io/dbt-data-modeling-challenge-movie-edition#div-whats-in-it-for-you)!

[What's in it for you?](https://www.paradime.io/dbt-data-modeling-challenge-movie-edition#div-whats-in-it-for-you)

### Step 4: Build data vizualizations
Once you've generated insights, you're required to use Lightdash for data vizualizations. Utilize Lightdash's provided [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4Y0KM0MroQ) and [documentation](https://docs.lightdash.com/) for best practices. 

### Step 5: Submitting Your Project
**Submission Deadline:** May 26th, 2024
Once your project is complete, please submit the following materials to Parker Rogers (parker@paradime.io) with Subject Line "<your_name> - Movie Data Modeling Challenge Submission":
- **GitHub Branch**: Send the link to your GitHub branch containing your dbt™ models.
- **README.md**: Include a README file that narrates your project's story, methodology, and insights. Check out this [example README](https://github.com/paradime-io/paradime-dbt-nba-data-challenge/blob/main/README.md#example-submission) from our previous NBA Data Modeling challenge.
