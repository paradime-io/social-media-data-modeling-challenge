Reddit, a popular social media platform, hosts a variety of user-generated content across numerous forums, where individuals discuss topics ranging from everyday life to global events. In this project we explore how sentiment on Reddit has evolved over time during pandemic and discover underlying reasons of sentiment score changes using cutting edge tools suchs as paradime.io for data transformation, MotherDuck for datawarehousing and HEX for analysis and visualization. Also, a public dataset containing a comprehensive collection comments mentioning COVID in their body text is used. Some terms that are good to know:

- Subreddit is a specific forum or community within Reddit dedicated to a particular topic, interest, or theme.
- Comment is user-generated response to a post or another comment within a subreddit.
- Sentiment Score: A sentiment score is a numerical measure of the emotional tone in text, ranging from -1 for negative sentiment to +1 for positive, with 0 indicating neutrality.
- Upvotes are positive votes that users to express approval or agreement with a post or comment.
- Downvotes are negative votes that users to express disapproval or disagreement.

## Methodology üßÆ
The Reddit COVID dataset is uploaded to MotherDuck and then cleaned and transformed by using paradime.io to make it ready for analysis or visualization. On the otherhand, key events during covid dataset is generated by ChatGPT in CSV format with a prompt and it's created as a table in MotherDuck using dbt seed function in paradime.io. A final notebook is created in HEX for the analysis and visulaziton of the data and finally, a public HEX app is built from the notebook to present insights. 

### Tools Used üîß
- Paradime: SQL and dbt‚Ñ¢ development
- MotherDuck: Data storage and computing
- Hex: Data visualization
- ChatGPT: Used to get the key events during Covid-19 in CSV

*"As of today my wife is still sedated and on the ventilator with no signs of improving. <br>
There were a couple times were they tried to start weaning her off the ventilator but as soon as they've done that her oxygen level dropped <br> and they had to put her back on the ventilator full time. <br>
My wife has been sick before in the past quite a few times and she always fought through to get better but now after 3 weeks. <br>
I have come to accept that my wife may pass away and the peace I have about it is that I know without a shadow of a doubt that she will be going home to be with the Lord but I also do believe in miracles and I'm holding on to the chance that she may get healed but if not I am thankful for her I know we've been married for 8 years. <br>
So think about what I wrote and think about if this thing is a fake crisis."*

This visual captures the rollercoaster of emotions experienced by users discussing COVID-19 on the "coronavirus" subreddit from March 2020 to October 2021. The sentiment score, calculated based on comments containing the keyword "covid," provides a fascinating glimpse into the collective mood and mindset of the online community during this unprecedented period.

#### A Journey Through the Pandemic:

1. **March to May 2020: The Height of Uncertainty and Fear**
   - During the initial outbreak of COVID-19, the sentiment score plummets deeply into the negative. This is reflected in the sharp drop, particularly in April and May, where the score falls below -400. The bright red and orange bars suggest a period of intense fear, uncertainty, and negativity as the world grappled with the sudden onset of the pandemic and its implications.
   
2. **June to December 2020: A Gradual Adaptation**
   - As the pandemic progresses into mid-2020, the sentiment score begins to show signs of stabilization, although still largely negative. The less intense yellow and light green bars indicate a shift from panic to a more measured response. People were starting to adapt to the "new normal," though challenges and negative sentiment persisted, perhaps due to the ongoing effects of lockdowns and rising case numbers.

3. **January to May 2021: Hope on the Horizon**
   - The new year brings a shift in sentiment. The bars gradually move closer to the zero line, and we even see positive scores starting to emerge. This period likely reflects growing optimism fueled by vaccine rollouts and a sense of hope that the end of the pandemic might be in sight. Comments during this time likely discussed the potential for recovery and a return to normalcy.

4. **June to October 2021: Mixed Emotions Amidst Recovery**
   - As we move into mid-2021, the sentiment becomes more balanced with frequent fluctuations between slightly positive and slightly negative scores. The green and blue bars indicate a community that is cautiously optimistic but still navigating the complexities of an ongoing global health crisis. Topics such as vaccine hesitancy, new variants, and reopening plans likely contributed to the mixed sentiments observed during this period.

#### Reflecting on the Community‚Äôs Experience:

This visual clearly shows how the sentiment of the "coronavirus" subreddit evolved in response to the different phases of the pandemic. From initial shock and fear to cautious optimism and ongoing challenges, this chart encapsulates the emotional journey of a global community navigating an unprecedented event.

</div>
<br /><br />

At the onset of COVID-19, one significant event that heavily impacted global sentiment was the World Health Organization (WHO) officially declaring COVID-19 a pandemic. This announcement triggered widespread panic and led to stricter regulations worldwide. The situation worsened when global cases surpassed 1 million, causing a major wave of fear and anxiety in Reddit community. 

However, a pivotal event that shifted overall sentiment from negative to positive occurred when Pfizer announced its vaccine was over 90% effective, igniting hope and sparking widespread discussions about vaccination. By the end of 2021, the U.S. FDA fully approved the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, marking a moment of significant optimism‚Äîthe date recorded as having the highest positive sentiment during the pandemic in many online communities.

## Conclusions
The analysis of Reddit comments during the COVID-19 pandemic reveals a fluctuating pattern of sentiment, closely aligned with key events and societal responses. Initially, sentiments were overwhelmingly negative, marked by fear and uncertainty, especially around the declaration of the pandemic and rising global cases. As time progressed and vaccines became available, there was a notable shift towards optimism, particularly following announcements of successful vaccine trials. However, challenges such as lockdowns, new variants, and vaccine hesitancy led to a mix of emotions throughout 2021. These sentiment shifts highlight the pandemic's profound impact on public mood, reflecting the balance between hope for recovery and ongoing anxieties. Understanding these emotional trends can offer valuable insights for addressing public concerns in future crises.
